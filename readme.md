# JSON Resume -> .pdf

[TOTALLY A WORK IN PROGRESS!] It does work. But kind of. And everything might get completely reengineered at any point. ðŸ™ƒ

Use with caution for now.

## What it does
As simple as:
- Save your resume as a `resume.json` gist on Github;
- Make sure it conforms to this [schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/master/schema.json);
- Choose the theme you want to use by setting your `$.meta` section in your `resume.json` like this:
    ```
    {
        "meta" : {
            "author" : "[theme-author-name]",
            "name" : "[theme-name]"
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
- Go to `cv.marcopist.com/{your-github-username}`
- Find your cv rendered as a pdf, enjoy!
